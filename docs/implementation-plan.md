# Passion Cosmetic — Phase-by-Phase Implementation Plan

**Document version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Execution roadmap  
**Documentation language:** English  
**Application interface language:** French only  
**Architecture:** Laravel modular monolith, Blade storefront with Vue islands, Vue 3 admin SPA  
**Data and infrastructure:** MySQL, Redis, Sentry  
**Deployment:** Deployment-neutral; deployment plans are produced separately by Codex  
**Related documents:**  
- `prd.md`
- `roles-authorization-matrix.md`

# 1. Purpose

This document defines the exact implementation sequence required to deliver the complete Passion Cosmetic platform.

It is written for Codex and human developers.

The plan is intentionally phased so that:

- Every phase has a clear business outcome.
- Every phase has a testable acceptance gate.
- Security and performance are implemented continuously.
- Storefront and back-office work remain synchronized.
- Database, API, UI, and tests evolve together.
- No phase depends on undocumented assumptions.
- Deployment remains simple and neutral between Docker and non-Docker VPS plans.
- The final product can be released without a large last-minute integration phase.

This is not a calendar estimate. It is an execution order.

---

# 2. Delivery Strategy

## 2.1 Vertical slices

The project must be implemented as vertical slices.

A vertical slice includes, where applicable:

- Database migration
- Model and domain logic
- Policy
- Validation
- Service/action
- API endpoint
- Blade or Vue interface
- Automated tests
- Sentry-safe error handling
- Documentation update

Do not build all database tables first, then all APIs, then all UI.

## 2.2 Phase gates

A phase is complete only when:

- Its acceptance criteria pass.
- Required automated tests pass.
- Security checks pass.
- Static analysis passes.
- No new high or critical dependency issue exists.
- Documentation is updated.
- The feature is usable through the intended interface.
- No unresolved blocker is hidden for a later phase.

## 2.3 Merge strategy

Recommended:

- One feature branch per small deliverable
- One focused pull request per coherent vertical slice
- Human review required
- Main branch always releasable
- No direct production feature work on `main`

## 2.4 No deployment coupling

The application must work identically under:

- Docker deployment
- Non-Docker VPS deployment

Do not put container names, paths, or Docker-specific assumptions inside domain code.

---

# 3. Global Implementation Rules

Every phase must follow these rules.

## 3.1 Read first

Before coding, Codex must read:

1. This implementation plan
2. The relevant source-of-truth documents
3. Existing code in the affected module
4. Existing tests and conventions

## 3.2 Security first

For each change, identify:

- Authentication requirement
- Authorization requirement
- Input validation
- Personal data
- Secret data
- Rate limiting
- Audit requirement
- Idempotency
- Concurrency
- Logging and Sentry redaction

## 3.3 Performance first

For each public feature, identify:

- Server-rendering behavior
- JavaScript cost
- Query count
- Cache behavior
- Image behavior
- Core Web Vitals impact

## 3.4 No invented scope

Codex must not add:

- Customer accounts
- Online payment
- Reviews
- Newsletter collection
- WebSockets
- Live chat
- Multi-vendor behavior
- Multiple languages
- Nested categories
- Per-variant price
- Arbitrary analytics
- Additional roles

## 3.5 Tests in the same change

A feature is not complete if its tests are postponed.

## 3.6 French UI

All visible interface text must be French.

Source code, API fields, tests, and documentation remain English.

# 8. Recommended Codex Prompt Pattern

Use one focused prompt per PR-sized slice.

```text
Implement PR <number> for Passion Cosmetic.

Read first:
- docs/<relevant files>

Scope:
- <exact deliverable>

Required:
- Follow API contracts
- Follow security rules
- Follow design tokens
- Add tests
- Run quality commands
- Update documentation if behavior changes

Do not:
- Add unrelated features
- Change approved business rules
- Weaken security or types
- Introduce deployment-specific domain behavior

At the end, provide:
- Files changed
- Decisions
- Commands run and results
- Remaining issues
```

---

# 9. Critical Dependency Order

The following order must not be reversed without an ADR.

```text
Foundation
  -> Authentication
  -> Design system
  -> Catalog domain
  -> Public catalog
  -> Cart
  -> Checkout/orders
  -> Admin catalog
  -> Admin orders
  -> Settings/content/promotions
  -> Complaints
  -> Meta
  -> Dashboard/audit
  -> SEO/accessibility
  -> Hardening
  -> UAT
  -> Release
```

Examples:

- Do not implement Meta before stable order creation and transitions.
- Do not implement checkout before authoritative cart quote.
- Do not implement admin product forms before catalog invariants.
- Do not implement dashboard revenue before order statuses.
- Do not enable consent-based Meta tracking before privacy behavior exists.

# 12. Source of Truth

This file is the source of truth for implementation sequence.

When Codex proposes a different order, it must explain:

- How acceptance gates remain protected

No phase may be skipped only because a feature appears simple.
