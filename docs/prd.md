# 1. Product Overview

## 1.1 Product Summary

The product is a high-performance e-commerce platform for a cosmetics brand and shop.

The platform will replace the current generic store-builder implementation with a custom Laravel-based solution that provides:

* A simple French-language shopping experience
* Product and variant management
* Guest cart and checkout
* Cash-on-delivery order management
* Configurable storefront content
* Strong technical SEO
* A simple French-language back office
* Reliable Meta Pixel and Meta Conversions API tracking
* Detailed Meta event diagnostics and retry handling
* Strong security, performance, and maintainability

Customers will not need to create accounts. They will browse products, add items to their cart, provide delivery information, and submit a Cash-on-Delivery order.

The main technical differentiator is a controlled Meta tracking implementation combining browser-side Meta Pixel events with server-side Conversions API events.

4. Provide reliable Meta `Purchase` event delivery through Pixel and Conversions API.
5. Prevent duplicate Meta events through event-ID deduplication.
6. Provide logs, retries, and diagnostics for Meta server events.
7. Deliver strong mobile performance and SEO.
8. Keep the operational workflow appropriate for a small cosmetics business.
9. Avoid unnecessary customer accounts, online payment complexity, and real-time infrastructure.
10. Keep the architecture maintainable and suitable for Codex-assisted implementation.

## 1.4 Non-Goals

A product supports the following fields.

### Required fields

* Name
* Category
* Regular price
* Stock when the product has no variants
* Active/inactive status

### Optional fields

* Short description
* Full description
* Promotional price
* Product gallery
* Variant groups
* Variant combinations
* Low-stock threshold
* SEO title
* SEO description
* Custom slug

### Automatically generated field

* Slug, generated from the product name and editable by an authorized user

## 4.2 Product Status

### Active product

An active product:

* Is visible on the public storefront

## 4.3 Product Pricing

Each product has one regular price.

A product may have one promotional price.

Variant combinations inherit the product-level regular and promotional prices.

The promotional price must:

* Be greater than or equal to zero
* Be lower than the regular price
* Be ignored when empty

When a promotional price exists, the storefront displays:

* The regular price
* The promotional price
* An automatically calculated discount-percentage badge

Example:

* Regular price: 100 TND
* Promotional price: 80 TND
* Displayed badge: `-20%`

The badge must appear consistently on:

* Homepage product cards
* Custom product sections
* Category pages
* Search results
* General product listings
* Product-details pages

## 4.4 Categories

Categories remain flat.

The system will not support parent categories or subcategories.

Each product belongs to exactly one category.

Authorized users can:

* Create categories
* Edit categories
* Activate or deactivate categories
* Reorder categories
* Delete unused categories

A category that is referenced by products must not be deleted until those products are reassigned or handled according to a defined safe-deletion workflow.

## 4.5 Variants

A product may have:

* No variant groups
* One variant group
* Multiple variant groups

Example variant groups:

* Color
* Size
* Volume
* Packaging

Example:

* Color: Green, Blue
* Size: Small, Medium

The system supports multiple values for each variant group.

Each resulting variant combination may have:

* Its own stock
* Its own optional image
* Its own internal identifier or SKU if introduced in the system design
* Active or unavailable state if required by the implementation

Prices remain product-level and do not vary by combination.

## 4.6 Variant Image Behaviour

A variant combination may optionally have an image.

When the customer selects a variant with an assigned image:

* The variant image becomes the main product image
* Other product images remain accessible in the gallery
* Desktop thumbnails are displayed vertically
* Mobile thumbnails are displayed horizontally

When the selected variant has no image:

* The current product image remains displayed, or
* The default primary product image is used

A customer must select all required variant values before adding a variant-based product to the cart.

---

# 5. Homepage and Storefront Content

## 5.1 Default Homepage Sections

The homepage is a mobile-first, server-rendered Blade page. Vue is used only for approved interactive islands such as the hero carousel, search, cart quantity badge, and optional horizontal enhancements.

The default homepage supports the following section order:

1. Announcement bar
2. Main header
3. Hero carousel
4. Circular category explorer
5. Best-sellers introduction

* Recommended products
* New collection

For each custom section, the Super Admin can:

* Enter a section title
* Activate or deactivate the section
* Reorder the section

* Category explorer imagery and labels
* Editorial and product section content
* Footer content
* Phone number
* Email address
* Physical address
* WhatsApp link
* Social-media links
* Static-page SEO titles
* Static-page SEO descriptions

## 5.4 Content Consistency

Values such as delivery fees and free-shipping thresholds must be stored once and reused throughout the application.

The platform must not require the owner to manually update the same business value in multiple unrelated pages.

---

# 6. Search, Filtering, and Product Discovery

## 6.1 Global Search

A search field must remain accessible in the storefront top bar.

It searches:

* Product names
* Category names

Selecting a product result opens the product-details page.

Selecting a category result opens the category page.

## 6.2 Product Filters

The initial product filtering scope includes:

* Category
* Price range
* Promotional products only

## 6.3 Sorting

Product results can be sorted by:

* Newest
* Price ascending
* Price descending
* Name

## 6.4 Category Pages

Selecting a category opens a dedicated category page.

The category page:

* Displays all active products in that category
* Supports price filtering
* Supports promotional-product filtering
* Supports the agreed sorting options
* Includes SEO metadata and an indexable URL

## 6.5 Section Filters

Each configurable product section can independently enable or disable its filtering interface.

---

# 7. Cart

## 7.1 Cart Type

The system uses a guest cart.

No customer account is required.

## 7.2 Cart Persistence

The cart is stored in the browser and:

* Survives page refreshes
* Survives browser reopening
* Expires after seven days

## 7.3 Cart Actions

Customers can:

* Add products
* Add selected product variants
* Change quantities
* Remove items
* Open the cart from the top bar

The top-bar cart icon displays the total item quantity.

## 7.4 Stock Behaviour

The cart does not reserve stock.

Stock is validated again:

* When checkout is opened
* When the order is submitted

The customer cannot submit quantities exceeding available stock.

## 7.5 Server Authority

The browser cart is not trusted for:

* Product prices
* Promotional prices
* Stock
* Discount amounts
* Shipping fees
* Final totals

Laravel must recalculate all values before creating the order.

Inactive, deleted, invalid, or unavailable products must be removed or rejected with a clear French message.

Example:

> La quantité demandée n’est plus disponible. Votre panier a été mis à jour avec le stock disponible.

---

# 8. Checkout

## 8.5 Promo-Code Field Visibility

The promo-code field can be:

* Displayed
* Hidden

Only the Super Admin can control its visibility.

The initial deployment may keep it hidden until the owner decides to use promo codes.

## 8.6 Order Submission

When checkout is submitted, Laravel must:

1. Validate all fields.
2. Revalidate products and variants.
3. Revalidate stock.
4. Recalculate prices.
5. Validate the promo code when provided.
6. Calculate the shipping fee.
7. Calculate the final total.

10. Create the initial order status.
11. Create the Meta attribution and event records.
12. Dispatch required asynchronous Meta jobs.

---

# 9. Shipping

## 9.1 Fixed Delivery Fee

The store uses one fixed delivery fee for all products and orders.

The Super Admin configures the delivery fee.

## 9.2 Free-Shipping Threshold

The Super Admin may configure a free-shipping threshold.

When the eligible order subtotal reaches or exceeds the threshold:

* Delivery fee becomes zero
* The storefront displays free delivery

The threshold may be enabled, disabled, or modified.

## 9.3 Calculation Example

Configured values:

* Delivery fee: 8 TND
* Free-shipping threshold: 120 TND

Order subtotal of 90 TND:

* Delivery: 8 TND
* Final total: 98 TND

Order subtotal of 130 TND:

* Delivery: Free
* Final total: 130 TND

## 9.4 Consistent Display

The same configured values must be reused in:

* Announcement bar
* Cart
* Checkout
* Order summary
* Order-confirmation page
* Delivery policy
* Terms and conditions where applicable

---

# 10. Promo Codes

## 10.1 Promo-Code Scope

Promo codes:

* Are used only during checkout
* Apply percentage-based discounts only
* Have a global usage limit
* Do not have per-customer limits
* Can be active or inactive

## 10.2 Promo-Code Fields

A promo code includes:

* Code
* Percentage discount
* Global usage limit
* Current usage count
* Active/inactive status
* Optional start date
* Optional end date
* Optional minimum order amount

## 10.3 Usage Limit

The usage limit defines the total number of successful orders on which the code may be applied.

Example:

* Code: `BEAUTY20`
* Discount: 20%
* Usage limit: 200
* Current usage: 46

The code becomes unavailable after the usage limit is reached.

## 10.4 Active/Inactive Status

An active code can be used when all other rules pass.

An inactive code remains stored but cannot be used.

## 10.5 Concurrency Requirement

Promo-code usage validation and incrementing must be handled safely so concurrent checkout submissions cannot exceed the configured limit.

---

# 11. Order Lifecycle

## 11.1 Order Statuses

Primary flow:

`Nouvelle → Confirmée → Livrée`

Alternative outcomes:

`Nouvelle → Annulée`

`Confirmée → Échec de livraison`

`Livrée → Retournée`

## 11.2 Status Definitions

### Nouvelle

The customer has successfully submitted the order.

### Confirmée

The store has contacted the customer and accepted or confirmed the order.

### Livrée

The order has been successfully delivered.

### Annulée

The order was cancelled before confirmation.

Possible reasons:

* Customer cancellation
* Invalid phone number
* Customer unreachable during confirmation
* Duplicate order
* Suspected fraudulent order

### Échec de livraison

The order was confirmed but could not be delivered.

Possible reasons:

* Customer refused the parcel
* Customer did not answer the delivery agent
* Incorrect delivery information
* Delivery could not be completed

### Retournée

The order was delivered and later returned.

## 11.3 Allowed Transitions

Only valid transitions may be applied.

The backend must enforce transition rules even if a frontend request is manipulated.

## 11.4 Order Editing

Orders may be edited only while their status is:

* Nouvelle
* Confirmée

Editable information may include:

* Customer full name
* Phone number
* City
* Address
* Product quantities
* Selected variants
* Eligible custom checkout values

Orders become read-only after:

* Livrée
* Annulée
* Échec de livraison
* Retournée

Internal notes may remain appendable according to authorization rules.

## 11.5 Transactional Recalculation

When quantities or variants are changed, the system must:

1. Validate the new request.
2. Restore previous stock allocations.
3. Validate new stock availability.
4. Deduct new stock allocations.
5. Recalculate subtotal.
6. Recalculate promotional pricing.
7. Recalculate promo-code discount.
8. Recalculate shipping.
9. Recalculate final total.
10. Save the modification atomically.
11. Record all relevant changes in the audit log.

## 11.6 Order Deletion

Orders must never be permanently deleted through normal back-office operations.

Historical data must remain available for:

* Audit
* Analytics
* Meta diagnostics
* Customer complaints
* Business reporting

---

# 12. Inventory

## 12.1 Stock Location

For products without variants:

* Stock is stored at product level.

For products with variants:

* Stock is stored per purchasable variant combination.

## 12.2 Stock Deduction

Stock is deducted immediately when a new order is successfully created.

## 12.3 Stock Restoration

Stock is restored automatically when an order becomes:

* Annulée
* Échec de livraison

For a returned order, the Admin must choose whether returned items are suitable for restocking.

This decision is required because opened or damaged cosmetic products may not be resellable.

## 12.4 Low-Stock Threshold

A product or variant may have an optional low-stock threshold.

The dashboard displays:

* Low-stock items
* Out-of-stock items

## 12.5 Insufficient Stock

Checkout must be blocked when stock is insufficient.

Stock checks and deductions must use database-safe concurrency controls to avoid overselling.

---

# 13. Order Confirmation

## 13.1 Customer Notifications

The initial version does not send:

* Email confirmations
* SMS messages
* WhatsApp messages

## 13.2 Confirmation Page

After successful order submission, the customer sees a confirmation page containing:

## 16.3 Revenue Definition

Operational revenue is calculated from orders with status `Livrée`.

Orders in `Nouvelle` or `Confirmée` do not count as realized revenue.

Meta may receive a `Purchase` event at another configured status, but that does not change the platform’s internal revenue definition.

---

# 17. Meta Pixel and Conversions API

## 17.1 Tracking Objective

The platform must provide the most reliable practical Meta conversion tracking possible without promising absolute equality between Meta Ads Manager and the order database.

The implementation combines:

* Browser Meta Pixel
* Server-side Meta Conversions API
* Matching event IDs
* Deduplication
* Customer and browser matching data
* Queue-based delivery
* Retry handling
* Idempotency
* Event logs
* Diagnostics
* Meta Test Events validation

## 17.2 Standard Storefront Events

The implementation may support standard events such as:

* PageView
* ViewContent
* Search
* AddToCart
* InitiateCheckout
* Purchase

The exact event matrix will be defined in the system design.

## 17.3 Purchase Trigger

The Meta `Purchase` trigger is configurable.

Available trigger statuses:

* Nouvelle
* Confirmée
* Livrée

Initial default:

`Nouvelle`

Therefore, in the initial configuration:

1. The customer submits checkout.
2. Laravel successfully creates the order.
3. The order receives status `Nouvelle`.
4. The browser sends `Purchase`.
5. Laravel queues the server-side CAPI `Purchase`.
6. Both use the same event ID.
7. Meta deduplicates them.

## 17.4 Purchase-Once Rule

A single order may produce the standard Meta `Purchase` event only once.

Changing the configured trigger:

* Applies only according to the safely defined activation policy
* Must not resend historical orders
* Must not produce another Purchase for an order already marked as sent
* Must not rewrite events already accepted by Meta

## 17.5 Delayed Purchase Trigger

If the trigger is changed to `Confirmée` or `Livrée`:

* No browser Purchase is sent during checkout
* Laravel stores the original attribution context
* Laravel sends the server-side Purchase when the selected status is reached
* The customer does not need to revisit the website

## 17.6 Attribution Context

The platform must preserve relevant attribution and matching data captured during checkout, subject to consent and privacy requirements.

This may include:

* `_fbp`
* `_fbc`
* Customer phone
* Customer name where permitted
* Customer location data where permitted
* IP address
* User agent
* Landing URL
* Referrer
* UTM parameters
* Original submission time
* Consent state

## 17.7 Meta Configuration

The Super Admin can manage:

* Meta Pixel ID
* Encrypted CAPI access token
* Tracking enabled/disabled state
* Purchase trigger
* Test mode
* Optional test-event code

## 17.8 Protected Trigger Change

Changing the Purchase trigger requires:

1. A prominent critical-setting warning
2. Selection of the new trigger
3. Re-entry of the Super Admin’s password
4. A typed confirmation phrase
5. A final modal showing the old and new values
6. Audit-log creation
7. Protection against accidental resending

Suggested warning:

> Critical Meta tracking setting. Changing this option affects which future orders are reported to Meta as purchases. An incorrect configuration may reduce campaign attribution quality or send conversions at the wrong stage. Existing Meta events will not be modified or resent.

## 17.9 Credential Update

When the owner changes their Meta Pixel or Meta dataset, the Super Admin can replace the integration credentials.

The update flow must:

1. Accept the new Pixel ID and token.
2. Test the new configuration.
3. Confirm Meta accepts a safe test event.
4. Require password confirmation.
5. Display the old and new Pixel IDs.
6. Activate the new configuration only after successful validation.
7. Record the change without logging the secret.
8. Keep the previous configuration active until the new one passes validation.

## 17.10 Secret Storage

Recommended storage model:

### Database settings

* Pixel ID
* Purchase trigger
* Tracking enabled status
* Test mode

### Encrypted database value

* Meta CAPI access token

### Environment or deployment secrets

* Laravel application key
* Database password
* Redis password
* Infrastructure credentials
* Other deployment-specific secrets

The CAPI token must never be:

* Sent to Vue
* Exposed to the browser
* Written to logs
* Stored in plaintext
* Committed to Git

---

# 18. SEO Requirements

## 18.1 Rendering

Public storefront pages must provide search-engine-readable HTML.

The final architecture may use:

* Laravel Blade
* Server-side rendering
* Another SEO-safe rendering strategy approved in the system design

A purely client-rendered storefront without an SEO strategy is not acceptable.

## 18.2 Product SEO

Each product supports:

* SEO title
* SEO description
* Editable slug
* Canonical URL
* Open Graph metadata
* Product structured data

Fallback values must be generated when optional SEO fields are empty.

## 18.3 Category SEO

Each category page requires:

* Unique URL
* Unique title
* Unique or generated description
* Canonical URL
* Indexable product content

## 18.4 Site-Wide SEO

The platform must support:

* XML sitemap
* Robots configuration
* Canonical URLs
* Open Graph tags
* Social-sharing images
* Product structured data
* Breadcrumb structured data
* Correct heading hierarchy
* Image alternative text
* French-language metadata
* Human-readable French slugs
* Redirect management for changed slugs
* Prevention of duplicate-content indexing
* Prevention of empty or inactive sections being indexed unnecessarily

---

# 19. Performance Requirements

Performance is a core product requirement.

## 19.1 General Principles

The platform must:

* Avoid real-time infrastructure
* Avoid unnecessary polling
* Avoid unnecessary frontend JavaScript
* Cache safe public data
* Queue slow background operations
* Optimize product media
* Minimize database queries
* Use appropriate database indexes
* Serve responsive images
* Lazy-load below-the-fold images
* Compress static assets

## 19.2 Performance Targets

Target public-storefront metrics at the 75th percentile on representative mobile traffic:

* Largest Contentful Paint: at or below 2.5 seconds
* Interaction to Next Paint: at or below 200 milliseconds
* Cumulative Layout Shift: at or below 0.1

Additional targets:

* Cached public pages should respond quickly under normal expected traffic.
* Checkout submission must not wait synchronously for Meta.
* Meta API calls must run through queues.
* Image processing must run asynchronously where applicable.
* Product and category queries must use appropriate indexes.
* Homepage and category content should be cacheable.
* Cache invalidation must occur when relevant content changes.

Exact load-test thresholds will be defined in the quality and system-design documents.

---

# 20. Non-Functional Requirements

## 20.1 Security

# 23. Success Metrics

## 23.1 Commerce Metrics

The platform should measure:

* Number of submitted orders
* Confirmation rate
* Delivery rate
* Cancellation rate
* Delivery-failure rate
* Return rate
* Delivered revenue
* Average delivered-order value
* Best-selling products
* Product conversion rate where measurable
* Cart-to-checkout rate
* Checkout completion rate

Initial commercial targets should be established after baseline data is collected.

## 23.2 Meta Tracking Metrics

The platform should measure:

* Number of eligible Purchase events

* Browser and server events share the same event ID when both are sent for the same purchase

## 23.3 Performance Metrics

Measure:

* LCP
* INP
* CLS
* Server response time
* Checkout response time
* Cache-hit rate
* Database-query count on key pages

# 25. Risks and Mitigations

## 25.1 Meta Attribution Differences

**Risk:** Meta Ads Manager may not exactly equal the order database.

**Mitigation:**

* Pixel and CAPI
* Event deduplication
* Stored attribution identifiers
* Correct customer-data normalization
* Event logs

**Risk:** Super Admin changes the Purchase trigger or credentials incorrectly.

**Mitigation:**

* Critical warning
* Password confirmation
* Typed confirmation phrase
* Connection test
* Audit log

# 27. Document Dependencies

This PRD is the product-level source of truth.

The following documents must derive from it:

1. Business Rules
2. Roles and Authorization Matrix
3. System Design
4. API Contracts
5. Security Rules
6. Privacy Document
7. Design Specification
8. Quality Rules
9. Detailed Phase-by-Phase Implementation Plan

When another document conflicts with this PRD, the conflict must be resolved explicitly rather than silently implemented.
