# Data Model: Phase 9.5 — Baseline Remediation

## Existing entities affected

### Order and order item

- Remain immutable financial and product snapshots after creation.
- Continue to store money as unsigned integer millimes and retain the existing public reference.
- Gain a retention-safe relationship to checkout idempotency data rather than relying on a
  permanent replay fingerprint embedded in the historical record.
- Allowed statuses remain `nouvelle`, `confirmee`, `livree`, `annulee`, `echec_livraison`, and
  `retournee`; invalid values are rejected at the durable-data boundary.

### Checkout field and order checkout value

- `checkout_fields` remains the source for active configuration: key, label, type, options,
  required state, active state, system state, and display order.
- `order_checkout_values` retains a normalized snapshot: field-key, label, type, value, and an
  optional reference to the configured field.
- Submission accepts only the active schema plus approved fixed delivery fields. Unknown keys,
  inactive required-field omissions, invalid options, and invalid types are rejected.

### Back-office user

- Retains public identifier, role, active state, and disabled timestamp.
- Adds password-state and session-revocation information necessary for forced password change
  and invalidating affected sessions after reset or password change.
- Roles remain `admin` and `super_admin`; only Super Admin can manage users and read audit logs.
- The final active Super Admin cannot be disabled, removed, or demoted.

### Product, variant, and inventory movement

- Existing price, stock, variant, and movement records remain authoritative.
- Durable rules reject invalid promotional-price relationships, non-negative stock violations,
  and invalid simple-versus-variant stock ownership.
- Existing movement history remains append-only and is linked to any restoration decision.

### Product image

- Retains private staging state, public derivative state, processing status, dimensions, and
  ownership by product.
- New operational metadata may record bounded processing attempts and terminal failure state;
  originals and staging files remain non-public.

## New entities

### Checkout idempotency record

| Field | Rules | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| id | Immutable primary identifier | Internal record identity |
| idempotency_key | Unique while active; UUID v4 | Identifies a replayable checkout request |
| canonical_payload_hash | Fixed-length fingerprint | Distinguishes same-key replay from conflict |
| order_id | Required immutable order relation | Returns the original successful outcome |
| expires_at | Required indexed timestamp | Enforces the approved replay window |
| created_at | Immutable timestamp | Supports retention processing |

The cleanup job removes or irreversibly detaches this record only after expiry. It never deletes
the related order, order items, checkout values, stock movement, or audit history.

### Audit log

| Field | Rules | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| id / public identifier | Immutable unique identity | Safe audit lookup |
| actor_user_id | Nullable protected user relation | Identifies the actor when applicable |
| actor_role_snapshot | Required when actor exists | Preserves authorization context |
| action | Required controlled value | Names the business operation |
| auditable_type / auditable_id | Required resource identity | Identifies affected resource |
| request_id | Nullable safe correlation value | Supports investigation without request body |
| before / after | Sanitized structured values | Records safe business change summary |
| created_at | Immutable timestamp | Establishes event order |

Audit logs are append-only. Values must exclude passwords, hashes, session values, tokens,
addresses, telephone numbers, raw attribution, and raw request bodies.

### Inventory restoration marker

| Field | Rules | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| id | Immutable primary identifier | Internal record identity |
| order_id | Required relation | Identifies the restored order |
| restoration_reason | Controlled cancellation, failed-delivery, or approved return value | Identifies the event |
| inventory_movement_id | Required relation | Links the resulting stock movement |
| created_at | Immutable timestamp | Supports audit and concurrency analysis |

A unique order-and-restoration scope prevents a duplicate command or concurrent request from
restoring stock twice.

## Relationships and lifecycle

```text
Order 1 ── 0..1 active CheckoutIdempotencyRecord
Order 1 ── * OrderCheckoutValue
Order 1 ── * OrderStatusHistory
Order 1 ── 0..* InventoryRestorationMarker ── 1 InventoryMovement
BackOfficeUser 1 ── * AuditLog
Order/Product/User/etc. 1 ── * AuditLog (polymorphic resource reference)
Product 1 ── * ProductImage
```

Order transitions remain:

```text
nouvelle → confirmee
nouvelle → annulee
confirmee → livree
confirmee → echec_livraison
livree → retournee
```

Only cancellation and failed delivery restore stock automatically. A return requires an explicit
restock decision. Every transition and eligible edit retains optimistic locking and produces a
sanitized audit event.

## Migration and preservation rules

- Use additive, backwards-compatible migrations before any removal or nullable-to-required
  contract step.
- Test direct constraint rejection and upgrade/forward-fix behavior against MySQL/MariaDB.
- Rehearse each changed migration with populated orders, archived orders, order snapshots, and
  related inventory data.
- Do not rewrite historical order totals, checkout snapshots, audit events, referenced variants,
  or Meta trigger snapshots.
- Treat rollback of populated `archived_at` data as forward-fix-only unless a safe restoration
  path is verified and documented.
